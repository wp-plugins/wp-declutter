This plugin lets you remove some of the default headers, tags and classes that WordPress inserts into your template by default.

== Description ==

This plugin lets you remove some of the default headers, tags and classes that WordPress inserts into your template by default. I personally find that some of them are unnecessary and just waste bandwidth.

The plugin currently lets you configure the following:

* In the head of HTML and XML documents
	* Feed links (blog and comment feeds)
	* Extra feed links (category, tag, author, search feeds)
	* Really Simple Discovery and Windows Live Manifest endpoint links
	* Links to previous/next posts
	* Generator tag which reveals which version of WordPress you are using
	* Shortlink tag
* In HTTP response headers:
	* Shortlink header
	* Redundant Etag headers
	* X-Pingback header
* Remove HTML body classes that you do not need (there is a huge list of classes that WordPress automatically inserts into the body tag)
* Remove post classes that you do not need (e.g., `type-`, `category-`, `tag-`)
* Remove comment classes that you do not need (e.g., `odd`, `even`, `alt`, `byuser`, `bypostauthor`, `depth-N`)
* Remove menu item classes that you do not need (e.g., `menu-item`, `current-menu-item`, `current_page_ancestor`)

If you come across any bugs or have suggestions, please [contact me](http://rayofsolaris.net) or use the support forums. I can't fix it if I don't know it's broken!
